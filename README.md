# Django Project Example

This repo is an example setup for a Django project using Docker and Docker Compose. The relevant "secret" settings, such as the `SECRET_KEY` and the database credentials are stored in `config/.env` (see the example `.env-example` for the format).

The tutorial for this project is on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ben.luginbuhl/setting-up-a-secure-django-project-repository-with-docker-and-django-environ-4af72ce037f0).
